## NACA Airfoil Theory (Fin Foil Shapes)

### NACA 4-Digit Symmetric Airfoil Thickness Distribution
- **Source:** National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA)
- **URL:** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NACA_airfoil
- **Relevance:** The classical NACA 4-digit thickness distribution equation:
  `y = (t/0.2) * (0.2969*sqrt(x) - 0.1260*x - 0.3516*x^2 + 0.2843*x^3 - 0.1015*x^4)`
  Our FinSystem.cs uses a simplified NACA-inspired distribution:
  `foilThickness = maxThick * sin(cT * pi)^0.6` which approximates the
  NACA profile (thickest at ~30% chord, tapers at edges) while being
  computationally simpler for voxel-based spatial painting.

### The NACA Airfoil Series (Stanford Course Material)
- **Source:** Stanford University, AA200 Course Material
- **URL:** https://web.stanford.edu/~cantwell/AA200_Course_Material/The%20NACA%20airfoil%20series.pdf

  including derivation of thickness distribution equations, camber line
  equations, and the combined coordinates. Background for understanding
  the relationship between our simplified fin foil and the classical NACA
  formulation.

- **Source:** Public Domain Aeronautical Software (PDAS)
- **URL:** https://www.pdas.com/naca456thick4.html
- **Relevance:** Detailed mathematical breakdown of the NACA 4-digit
  thickness distribution calculation with coefficients and modified
  trailing-edge formulations.

### NACA 4-Digit Airfoil Generator
- **Source:** Airfoil Tools
- **URL:** http://airfoiltools.com/airfoil/naca4digit
- **Relevance:** Interactive tool for generating NACA profiles. Useful for
  comparing the classical NACA distribution against our sin^0.6 approximation.

### NACA 4-Digit Airfoil Equations (Derivation and History)
- **Source:** Aerospaceweb.org
- **URL:** https://aerospaceweb.org/question/airfoils/q0100.shtml
- **Relevance:** Historical context on how NACA derived the thickness
  distribution equations empirically from successful airfoils of the 1930s
  rather than from first principles. Important context for understanding
  why the simplified sin^0.6 approach is equally valid -- both are
  empirical approximations to real-world foil shapes.
